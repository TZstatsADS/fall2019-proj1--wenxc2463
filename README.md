### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Hip-hop, a special genre
+ This project is conducted by Xiwen Chen 

+ Project summary: In this R notebook, I try to find the features of the hip-hop song lyrics through Q&A. I do the data processing and saved the tidy object in a R file. For the rock and pop songs account for over 60 percent of the total, I mainly study rock and pop songs inaddition to hip-hop songs. In conclusion, hip-hop lyrics like to use many spoken words, which are not commonly used in rock and pop songs. Hip-hop songs usually express negative emotions and words in hip-hop songs are rich.

+ Questions answered in this project: 
1. What are the most frequently used words in hip-pop lyrics? What about rock and pop?
2. What are the emotions of hip-pop songs? 
3. Are there many duplicate words in hip-hop songs?
